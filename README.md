# Poppet - Ultra-Realistic AI Roleplay Framework

A comprehensive SillyTavern preset designed to eliminate common AI writing failures and enforce ultra-realistic character behavior in roleplay scenarios.

## What It Solves

**Common AI Problems:**
- Purple prose and melodramatic reactions ("words hit like a physical blow")
- Characters knowing things they shouldn't (omniscience violations)
- Unrealistic physical capabilities
- Plot stagnation and reactive-only responses
- Generic emotional responses ignoring character background
- Meta-convenient solutions and wish-fulfillment scenarios
- Overly serious characters lacking natural humor
- Dialogue-heavy scenes missing body language and non-verbal cues

## Core Components

**Chain of Thought (COT) Template:** 10-section mandatory thinking process that forces systematic evaluation of realism, character consistency, plot progression, and technical implementation before generating responses.

**Specialized Prompts:**
- Authentic Reactions (anti-melodrama)
- Anti-Convenience Protocol
- Skill Limitations & Economic Reality  
- Natural Humor & Levity
- Non-Verbal Communication
- Physical Realism constraints
- Cultural authenticity checks

## Features

- **Anti-stagnation:** Built-in checks for plot progression and user engagement
- **Comprehensive coverage:** Addresses technical writing, psychology, world-building, and pacing

Tested primarily with Google Gemini but should work with any thinking instruction-following LLM (Deepseek Reasoner, GPT, Claude).
